Observe Traffic on Port 3306
Note: If you want to use tcpdump instead of Wireshark, replace tshark with tcpdump for all commands within the lab.

Observe the traffic going over port 3306. Ignore any warnings about running as root:

tshark -i eth0 'port 3306'
Observe there are a number of MySQL responses currently being generated.

Press CTRL + C to end the process.

Write the Report to a File
Save 50 samples of traffic to /tmp/mysql.pcap:

tshark -i eth0 -c 50 -w /tmp/mysql.pcap 'port 3306'
The counter in the output will indicate when 50 samples are saved.

Confirm the Report
Read the file to confirm:

tshark -r /tmp/mysql.pcap
Observe the attempted connections to port 3306 as well as some responses from the MySQL server.
