List all users: cat /etc/passwd
List groups: cat /etc/group
Package Management:

Update package database: sudo apt update (Debian/Ubuntu) or sudo yum update (RHEL/CentOS)
Install a package: sudo apt install package-name or sudo yum install package-name
Remove a package: sudo apt remove package-name or sudo yum remove package-name
System Updates:

Upgrade all packages: sudo apt upgrade or sudo yum upgrade
Perform a system reboot: sudo reboot
File and Directory Operations:

Create a new file: touch filename
Create a new directory: mkdir directory-name
Copy a file: cp source-file destination
Move/rename a file: mv old-file new-location
Remove a file: rm filename
Remove a directory: rm -r directory-name
File Permissions:

Change file permissions: chmod permissions filename
Change file ownership: chown new-owner filename
Change group ownership: chown :new-group filename
System Monitoring and Diagnostics:

Check system resource usage: top or htop
Display system information: uname -a
View disk space usage: df -h
View memory usage: free -h
View running processes: ps aux
Network Configuration:

Configure network interfaces: Edit /etc/network/interfaces (Debian/Ubuntu) or /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 (RHEL/CentOS)
Restart networking service: sudo service networking restart (Debian/Ubuntu) or sudo systemctl restart network (RHEL/CentOS)
Firewall Configuration:

Configure iptables: sudo iptables
Configure firewalld (RHEL/CentOS): sudo firewall-cmd
SSH Configuration:

Edit SSH configuration: sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Restart SSH service: sudo service ssh restart or sudo systemctl restart ssh
Logs and Troubleshooting:

View system logs: cat /var/log/syslog (Debian/Ubuntu) or cat /var/log/messages (RHEL/CentOS)
Check disk health: smartctl -a /dev/sda
Troubleshoot network connectivity: ping, traceroute, netstat
Cron Jobs:

Edit user's cron jobs: crontab -e
View user's cron jobs: crontab -l
Security Hardening:

Update security patches: sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade or sudo yum update
Configure firewall rules: sudo iptables (traditional) or sudo firewall-cmd (firewalld)
Audit user accounts and privileges
Enable SELinux (RHEL/CentOS) or AppArmor (Ubuntu) if needed
